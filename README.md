# Neuroevolution Flappy Bird

Building Flappy Bird in Python using Pygame and implementing NEAT algorithm from the article: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf. Finally, applying the algorithm to
make the birds learn how to fly through gaps in pipes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install beforehand:

```
Python 3.5
NumPy
PyGame
```

### Running

In order to see the results of applying NEAT to Flappy Bird:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/schizoburger/neuroevolution-flappy-bird.git
```
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder containing cloned repository
3. Type:
```
python3 flappy.py
```
4. Be patient and enjoy!
